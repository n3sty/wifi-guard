# WiFi Security Checker MVP

> Check suspicious networks like a cyber-security guard

A one-click WiFi security scanner designed to help anyone quickly assess the safety of public WiFi networks. Built for user testing and validation of the "Speedtest for WiFi security" concept.

## 🎯 Purpose

This MVP validates the core value proposition: **Can we make WiFi security assessment as simple as running Speedtest?**

**Target Users:** Anyone who uses public WiFi (especially non-technical users like parents, travelers, students)

**Key Innovation:** No network name input required - just one click to scan.

## ✨ Features

### Core Security Checks
- **HTTPS Detection**: Verifies encrypted connection to our app
- **Network Performance**: Measures response times for anomaly detection  
- **SSL Validation**: Tests certificate handling across multiple endpoints

### User Experience
- **One-Click Scanning**: No technical knowledge required
- **Clear Verdicts**: Safe 🟢 / Caution 🟡 / Risk 🔴
- **Educational Content**: Context-appropriate security tips
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for real-world public WiFi testing
- **Dark Mode**: Security-focused professional interface

### Analytics & Testing
- Built-in usage analytics for user testing
- Performance metrics and engagement tracking
- Export functionality for research analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Linting & Quality
```bash
npm run lint
```

## 🧪 User Testing

This MVP is ready for user testing with 10-15 participants. See [`USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md`](./USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md) for detailed testing protocols.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 80%+ complete scan without assistance
- ✅ 80%+ understand results (Safe/Caution/Risk)
- ✅ 70%+ would use again
- ✅ 70%+ would recommend to others

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Coffee Shop Test**: Check WiFi safety before banking
2. **Airport Test**: Evaluate suspicious network names
3. **Home Network Test**: Baseline for trusted networks

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Analytics**: Client-side usage tracking (privacy-focused)
- **Deployment**: Static export ready for Vercel/Netlify

### Security Checks Implementation

#### HTTPS Detection
```typescript
const isHttps = window.location.protocol === 'https:'
// Verdict: Failed if HTTP, Passed if HTTPS
```

#### Performance Analysis
```typescript
const testEndpoints = ['https://google.com/favicon.ico', ...]
// Measures response times, flags unusual delays
```

#### SSL Validation
```typescript
const testUrls = ['https://google.com', 'https://github.com']
// Tests certificate handling across endpoints
```

### Analytics
Simple client-side tracking without personal data collection:
- User interaction patterns
- Feature usage statistics  
- Session duration and engagement
- Device/browser information (for compatibility)

## 📊 Research Foundation

This MVP is built on comprehensive market research covering:
- ✅ Network security landscape analysis
- ✅ Browser API capabilities and limitations
- ✅ Competitive analysis (lack of simple tools)
- ✅ Business model validation (freemium approach)
- ✅ Technical feasibility assessment
